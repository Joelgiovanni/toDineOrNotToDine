# About this App
A API based app to randomly pick a restaurant from your location that returns restaurant info so that you have a easier time making a decision. The user's geolocation is found by the I.P. address and the latitude & longitude is the key.
This site was originally going to have Node & MongoDB running on backend but decided against it. (didnt need it)

# Tech
